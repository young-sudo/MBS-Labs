	abstract = {To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.},

	abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

Here we introduce ‘bridge integration’, a method to integrate single-cell datasets across modalities using a multiomic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multiomic dataset constitutes an element in a ‘dictionary’, which is used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach, implemented in version 5 of our Seurat toolkit (http://www.satijalab.org/seurat), broadens the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitates comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.},

	abstract = {Tumor blood vessels supply nutrients and oxygen to tumor cells for their growth and provide routes for them to enter circulation. Thus, angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for tumor progression and metastasis. Tumor endothelial cells (TECs) that cover the inner surfaces of tumor blood vessels reportedly show phenotypes distinct from those of their normal counterparts. As examples, TECs show cytogenetic abnormalities, resistance to anticancer drugs, activated proliferation and migration, and specific gene expression patterns. TECs contain stem-like cell populations, which means that the origin of TECs is heterogeneous. In addition, since some abnormal phenotypes in TECs are induced by factors in the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and tumor cell-derived factors, phenotypic diversity in TECs may be caused in part by intratumoral heterogeneity. Recent studies have identified that the interaction of tumor cells and TECs by juxtacrine and paracrine signaling contributes to tumor malignancy. Understanding TEC abnormality and heterogeneity is important for treatment of cancers. This review provides an overview of the diversity of TECs and discusses the interaction between TECs and tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment.},

	abstract = {Anti-angiogenic therapies (AATs) are used to treat different types of cancers. However, their success is limited owing to insufficient efficacy and resistance. Recently, single-cell omics studies of tumour endothelial cells (TECs) have provided new mechanistic insight. Here, we overview the heterogeneity of human TECs of all tumour types studied to date, at the single-cell level. Notably, most human tumour types contain varying numbers but only a small population of angiogenic TECs, the presumed targets of AATs, possibly contributing to the limited efficacy of and resistance to AATs. In general, TECs are heterogeneous within and across all tumour types, but comparing TEC phenotypes across tumours is currently challenging, owing to the lack of a uniform nomenclature for endothelial cells and consistent single-cell analysis protocols, urgently raising the need for a more consistent approach. Nonetheless, across most tumour types, universal TEC markers (ACKR1, PLVAP and IGFBP3) can be identified. Besides angiogenesis, biological processes such as immunomodulation and extracellular matrix organization are among the most commonly predicted enriched signatures of TECs across different tumour types. Although angiogenesis and extracellular matrix targets have been considered for AAT (without the hoped success), the immunomodulatory properties of TECs have not been fully considered as a novel anticancer therapeutic approach. Therefore, we also discuss progress, limitations, solutions and novel targets for AAT development.},

To better characterize the tumor progression trajectory, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of normal tissue, precancerous tissue, early-stage, advanced-stage cancer tissue, lymph node, and recurrent tumors tissue samples. We identify the transcriptional development trajectory of malignant epithelial cells and a tumorigenic epithelial subcluster regulated by TFDP1. Furthermore, we find that the infiltration of POSTN+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages gradually increases with tumor progression; their interaction or interaction with malignant cells also gradually increase to shape the desmoplastic microenvironment and reprogram malignant cells to promote tumor progression. Additionally, we demonstrate that during lymph node metastasis, exhausted CD8+ T cells with high CXCL13 expression strongly interact with tumor cells to acquire more aggressive phenotypes of extranodal expansion. Finally, we delineate the distinct features of malignant epithelial cells in primary and recurrent tumors, providing a theoretical foundation for the precise selection of targeted therapy for tumors at different stages. In summary, the current study offers a comprehensive landscape and deep insight into epithelial and microenvironmental reprogramming throughout initiation, progression, lymph node metastasis and recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.},

In order to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive tumor heterogeneity of this lethal disease, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of one high-grade glioma. Accordingly, we analyzed the individual cellular components in the ecosystem of this tumor. We found that tumor-associated macrophages are predominant in the immune microenvironment. Furthermore, we identified five distinct subpopulations of tumor cells, including one cycling, two OPC/NPC-like and two MES-like cell subpopulations. Moreover, we revealed the evolutionary transition from the cycling to OPC/NPC-like and MES-like cells by trajectory analysis. Importantly, we found that SPP1/CD44 interaction plays a critical role in macrophage-mediated activation of MES-like cells by exploring the cell-cell communication among all cellular components in the tumor ecosystem. Finally, we showed that high expression levels of both SPP1 and CD44 correlate with an increased infiltration of macrophages and poor prognosis of glioma patients. Taken together, this study provided a single-cell atlas of one high-grade glioma and revealed a critical role of macrophage-mediated SPP1/CD44 signaling in glioma progression, indicating that the SPP1/CD44 axis is a potential target for glioma treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The incidence of primary cutaneous melanoma has increased steadily for several decades and remains the most lethal form of cutaneous neoplasm. If diagnosed in the early stages, melanoma has high survival rates, approximating 94\%. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), from 2014 to 2018, the incidence of metastatic melanoma was estimated to be 0.9 per 100,000. Mucosal and ocular melanomas typically have worse prognoses. Melanoma was once considered a very aggressive cancer that was resistant to traditional therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation, and even single-agent targeted therapies in their early stages of development. A dramatic improvement in the quality of life and overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma has resulted after the advent of various new combinations of targeted therapies and different modalities of immunotherapies.  Melanoma is distinct from nonmelanoma skin cancers because it spreads locally, regionally, and distantly. An individual's risk of metastasis is directly related to the depth of invasion and ulceration of the primary lesion. The early stages of cancer metastasis involve invasion, angiogenesis, extravasation, dissemination, and colonization of the target organ. Patients with clinically node-negative disease and those with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy can still present with distant metastatic disease. Moreover, complete lymph node dissection has not been proven to offer a survival benefit to patients with node-positive disease. There are reports of the transfer of melanoma from a donor to a recipient after an organ transplant, even when the transplant was performed years after the donor was diagnosed with melanoma. Such distant seeding suggests the possibility of early subclinical micrometastasis in melanoma. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), only about 4\% of melanomas are present with metastasis.  Patients typically present with an asymmetrical large lesion that may also itch, bleed, ulcerate, or develop satellite lesions. Patients who present with metastatic disease or with primary sites other than the skin have signs and symptoms related to the affected organ systems. Once a suspicious skin lesion is identified, a biopsy must be performed to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma. An excisional biopsy is the preferred biopsy modality. Melanoma treatment typically involves wide local excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, digital amputations, or adjuvant therapy depending on tumor location, depth, ulceration, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.},

In this context, we conducted systematic research on SCS techniques, including the fundamental concepts, procedural steps, and applications of scDNA, scRNA, scATAC, scCITE, and scSNARE methods, focusing on the unique clinical advantages of SCS, particularly in cancer therapy. We have explored challenging but critical areas such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), lineage tracing, tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and tumor immunotherapy. Despite challenges in managing and analyzing the large amounts of data that result from SCS, this technique is expected to reveal new horizons in cancer research.

Both in primary and acquired resistance, MITF levels inversely correlate with the expression of several activated receptor tyrosine kinases, most frequently AXL. The MITF-low/AXL-high/drug-resistance phenotype is common among mutant BRAF and NRAS melanoma cell lines. The dichotomous behaviour of MITF in drug response is corroborated in vemurafenib-resistant biopsies, including MITF-high and -low clones in a relapsed patient. Furthermore, drug cocktails containing AXL inhibitor enhance melanoma cell elimination by BRAF or ERK inhibition. Our results demonstrate that a low MITF/AXL ratio predicts early resistance to multiple targeted drugs, and warrant clinical validation of AXL inhibitors to combat resistance of BRAF and NRAS mutant MITF-low melanomas.},

Depletion of both transcription factors from cultured melanoma cell lines produced an increase in AXL expression greater than depletion of MITF alone. Further, re-expression of BRN2 led to decreased AXL expression, indicating a role for BRN2 in regulation of AXL levels unrelated to effects on MITF level.

and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the
tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is
better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals
structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for
high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related,
low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple
classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure
of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on
neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data
to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We
illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and
compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques,
including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The
visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those
produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a popular data mining technique which discovers structure in unlabeled data by grouping objects together on the basis of a similarity criterion. Traditional similarity measures lose their meaning as the number of dimensions increases and as a consequence, distance or density based clustering algorithms become less meaningful. Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) is a solution to clustering high-dimensional data with the ability to find clusters of varying density. SNN assigns objects to a cluster, which share a large number of their nearest neighbors. However, SNN is compute and memory intensive for data of large size and/or dimensionality. Nearest neighbor queries are responsible for a major proportion of computations in SNN, resulting in lower efficiency for higher value of number of nearest neighbors (k). The main motivation of this work is to improve the efficiency of SNN and to parallelize it so that it can be used for clustering large high-dimensional datasets and for large values of k. Existing SNN algorithms become inefficient in these situations. In this paper, we present a new sequential SNN algorithm, R-SNN, which uses R-tree for executing neighborhood queries efficiently and exploiting spatial locality to minimize memory usage. R-SNN is benchmarked against the best available implementation of SNN and is found up to 77 times faster when tested on various real datasets. R-SNN is parallelized for distributed memory, shared memory, and hybrid systems. Significant speedup and scalability achieved can be attributed to parallelization and good load balancing strategies and also to exploitation of spatial locality. Experimental results demonstrate the same for datasets of varying dimensionality and size. The maximum speedup achieved for shared, distributed, and hybrid models are 427.19 using 48 threads, 394.24 using 32 processes, and 1380.69 on 32 nodes (with each node spawning 4 threads), respectively. Super-linear speedup for some datasets is attributed to optimized neighborhood queries. All the proposed algorithms produce identical clustering results as that of the classical SNN.},

A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL-7/STAT5 and cellular events such as immunoglobulin rearrangement, highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and "corrupted" developmental processes including cancer.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to dissect transcriptional heterogeneity arising from cellular types, spatio-temporal contexts and environmental stimuli. Transcriptional heterogeneity may reflect phenotypes and molecular signatures that are often unmeasured or unknown a priori. Cell identities of samples derived from heterogeneous subpopulations are then determined by clustering of scRNA-seq data. These cell identities are used in downstream analyses. How can we examine if cell identities are accurately inferred? Unlike external measurements or labels for single cells, using clustering-based cell identities result in spurious signals and false discoveries.We introduce non-parametric methods to evaluate cell identities by testing cluster memberships in an unsupervised manner. Diverse simulation studies demonstrate accuracy of the jackstraw test for cluster membership. We propose a posterior probability that a cell should be included in that clustering-based subpopulation. Posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) for cluster memberships can be used to select and visualize samples relevant to subpopulations. The proposed methods are applied on three scRNA-seq datasets. First, a mixture of Jurkat and 293T cell lines provides two distinct cellular populations. Second, Cell Hashing yields cell identities corresponding to eight donors which are independently analyzed by the jackstraw. Third, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are used to explore heterogeneous immune populations. The proposed P-values and PIPs lead to probabilistic feature selection of single cells that can be visualized using principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and others. By learning uncertainty in clustering high-dimensional data, the proposed methods enable unsupervised evaluation of cluster membership.https://cran.r-project.org/package=jackstraw.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
